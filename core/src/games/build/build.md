# Build Gameplay

Update this first, then align code with the design.

- Goal: freeform building sandbox with light combat; no win condition.
- Movement: walk + jump with a single air-jump, optional fly toggle, and swimming when underwater.
- Building: place single blocks at the aim point; volume placement uses a two-point selection to fill a rectangular region.
- Customization: block color cycling (scroll) applies to newly placed blocks.
- Combat: inventory includes a blaster and a dagger; hitmarker feedback when dealing damage.
- World: prebuilt voxel map with water, sky, and sun; block physics enabled for global + local blocks.
- NPCs: a pig with health and a shark that targets swimmers.

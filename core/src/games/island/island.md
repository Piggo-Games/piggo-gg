# Island Gameplay

Update this first, then align code with the design.

- Goal: turn-based combat against the monster (Patrick); abilities resolve via dice rolls.
- Turn structure: players take turns in order, then the monster takes a turn; rounds increment after the monster finishes.
- Player turn: select an ability scroll, then roll two dice; results trigger ability effects.
- Dice rules: two D6 rolls; 6+1 (or 1+6) is a special crit result; 7 triggers the spike event.
- Abilities: Rally and Slice exist as selectable scrolls; their effects are currently placeholders and should be defined.
- UI: dice display, scrolls, number board, hearts, and aiming cursor.

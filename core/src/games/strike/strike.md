# Strike Gameplay

Update this first, then align code with the design.

- Goal: team-based shooter with round structure and KDA tracking.
- Phases: warmup (ready up) -> round-start (spawn) -> round-play/round-end/game-end (not fully implemented).
- Movement: FPS-style movement with a single air-jump; optional first/third person camera toggle.
- Combat: pistol loadout, ammo + health UI, hitmarker feedback, and kill/death tracking.
- Teams: team switching allowed only during warmup; spawn points are team-specific.
- World: voxel map (RetakeMap) with block physics, sky, and sun.

# Volley Gameplay

Update this first, then align code with the design.

- Goal: win points by landing the ball on the opposing side; first to 7 resets the match.
- Teams: 2v2; bots fill empty slots to keep teams even.
- Phases: serve -> play -> point (ball landing resolves point and resets serve).
- Serve rules: serving team hits first; no airborne spike on the first serve hit; no immediate double-hits.
- Rally rules: max 3 hits per team, max 1 air hit per player, and no consecutive hits by the same player.
- Extras: landing target indicator shows predicted ball landing spot.

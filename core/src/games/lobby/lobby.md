# Lobby Gameplay

Update this first, then align code with the design.

- Purpose: main menu + matchmaking hub; no win/lose state.
- Flow: players join a lobby; the leader picks a game card to start that mode.
- UI: game cards (Build, Volley, Island, Mars), lobby list, profile card, music toggle, and players-online counter.
- Networking: delay netcode; only lightweight UI logic and background scene.
